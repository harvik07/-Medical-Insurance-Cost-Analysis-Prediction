# -Medical-Insurance-Cost-Analysis-Prediction
This project analyzes a medical insurance dataset to explore the factors affecting insurance charges and predict individual costs using machine learning and statistical modeling.

📊 Objectives
Understand how demographic and lifestyle variables (like age, BMI, and smoking) affect insurance charges.

Categorize BMI and analyze its impact using ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD tests.

Build a linear regression model to predict insurance charges.

Perform exploratory data analysis and visualize correlations between variables.

⚙️ Key Techniques Used
Data Preprocessing

BMI classification into: Underweight, Healthy, Overweight, Obese

Label encoding of categorical variables

Statistical Tests

ANOVA to compare charges across groups (e.g. smoker vs non-smoker, regions, BMI categories)

Tukey’s HSD post-hoc test to identify pairwise group differences

Machine Learning

Built a Linear Regression model using age, bmi, and smoker status to predict charges

Evaluated model performance using R² Score

Visualization

Correlation heatmap to understand interdependencies between variables
